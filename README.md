# Hi, I'm Liz 👋 👩‍💻

I'm a senior software engineer who is passionate about teaching code, learning new tech stacks and techniques, design systems, reading, mechanical keyboards, and emoji.

My weekdays involve building and collaborating for @HubSpot's [Canvas design system](https://canvas.hubspot.com), a React-based design system used by hundreds of engineers, designers, content creators, and others.
